Texext development Changelog

Texext started life as the ``math_dollar`` Sphinx extension by Ondřej Čertík
(OC) along with an extension for working with Sympy math by Matthew Brett
(MB).

Releases
********

0.3.0
=====

Bugfix release:

* Use different method to get text to parse in Sphinx pages.  We were
  previously getting the raw ReST text and trying to do partial parsing with
  regexps, but this was getting brittle, and there were already some nasty
  bugs to do with the order we were putting back stuff we had taken out.
  Instead, look for math dollars in the parsed doctree, so we can avoid
  things like literal blocks via the ReST parser.  We continue to use the
  regex parser on docstrings though;
* Deal with multiple backticks used as sphinx section underlines, confusing
  the regex parser;
* No longer exclude all indented lines from math dollar parsing, because it's
  fairly common to have math dollars in list items, which are indented;
* Extend tests to cover math in list elements;

0.2.0
=====

Bugfix release:

* Fix use of custom plot_directive;
* Some testing fixes;

0.1.0
=====

Initial release:

* Refactored ``math_dollar`` extension to exclude more potential false
  positives, add tests;
* Add ``mathcode`` directive.
